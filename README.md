**#Machine Learning with Python - Sklearn and Scipy - Using Opensource Datasets**

IBM Cognitive AI Projects

**1.Simple Linear Regression Model** - Predict CO2 emission for given engine size

**2.Multiple Linear Regression Model** - Predict CO2 emission for Engine Size, Fuel Consumption, number of Cylinders in car

**3.Polynomial Regression Model** - Predict CO2 emission for Engine Size, Fuel Consumption, number of Cylinders in car. Apply Feature transformation(Here degree = 2)

**4.Non linear regression model** to fit GDP and year(Basic)

**5.K-Nearest Neighbours** - A Telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four types of Services opted.(Basic, Extra, Special, Total). Given the Customer demographics dataset, with predefined labels, build a model to be used to predict class of a new or unknown customer.

**6.Decision Trees** - Given historical data of patients - Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol, and their response to different medications(which drug is suited - Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y), predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient

**7.Logistic regression model**(Confusion matrix, metrics, similarity)
Given Data:
- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn(1/0)
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
- Predict - the customers who will stay with the company

**8.Support Vector Machines** - Given cell characterisitics(UCI Machine Learning Repository Cancer Dataset) predict whether tumor is Malignant/Beningn. (Using default - Radial Basis Function Kernel) uisng SVM classification model

**9.K-Means Clustering model** for 
	1.Random generated data
	2.Customer Segmentation based on Age, Education,incomes and debts -- into three classes(Old and Affluent, Middle aged and Mid Income, Young and Low income)

**10.Hierarchical clustering**
Agglomerative clustering model for random generated data
Vehicle Dataset - Competitor analysis -- which segment is the new car competing with(based on mileage, horse power, price and other specs. ) by splitting them into multiple clusters
Cars:
- Cluster 1: with almost high mpg, and low in horsepower.
- Cluster 2: with good mpg and horsepower, but higher price than average.
- Cluster 3: with low mpg, high horsepower, highest price.
Trucks:
- Cluster 1: with almost highest mpg among trucks, and lowest in horsepower and price.
- Cluster 2: with almost low mpg and medium horsepower, but higher price than average.
- Cluster 3: with good mpg and horsepower, low price.

**11.Density Based Clustering Model**
1. on Randomly generated dataset and differentiated between K-Means and DBSCAN
2. DBSCAN model on Weather Station Clustering based on location, temperature - min, max, mean etc.

**12.Content Based recommendation**: Item to Item Recommendation -- for Users based on movies watched from Movie Dataset

**13.Collaborative Filtering**: User to User Recommendation -- Based on similar users using pearson correlation, recommend our target users with a list of movies.
